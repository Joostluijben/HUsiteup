script to check if the HU (Hogeschool Utrecht) site (my college site) is up

Since my college site was down AGAIN, I made a script to check whether the site is up. 
The problem was, I had to login to check if it was up. With this script you can at least reach every sharepoint site. I haven't check the hubl sites
I hope I can help some other students with this too
